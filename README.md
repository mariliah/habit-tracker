# Habit Tracker

<p>I've decided to create a very simple application for tracking habits to help me learn Java.</p>

<p>The app will helps users track their habits, set goals, visualize progress, and receive motivating reminders. Planning to incorporate features for habit scheduling, progress visualization (e.g., charts and graphs), customizable reminders, and data persistence.</p>
